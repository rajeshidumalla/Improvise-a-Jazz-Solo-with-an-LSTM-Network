# Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network

Welcome! In this notebook, I will implement a model that uses an LSTM to generate music. We will even be able to listen to our own music at the end of this project.

**We will learn to:**
- Apply an LSTM to music generation.
- Generate your own jazz music with deep learning.

## 1 - Problem statement

We would like to create a jazz music piece specially for a friend's birthday. However, we don't know any instruments or music composition. Fortunately, we know deep learning and will solve this problem using an LSTM netwok.  

We will train a network to generate novel jazz solos in a style representative of a body of performed work.

I have taken care of the preprocessing of the musical data to render it in terms of musical "values." You can informally think of each "value" as a note, which comprises a pitch and a duration. For example, if you press down a specific piano key for 0.5 seconds, then you have just played a note. In music theory, a "value" is actually more complicated than this--specifically, it also captures the information needed to play multiple notes at the same time. For example, when playing a music piece, you might press down two piano keys at the same time (playng multiple notes at the same time generates what's called a "chord"). But we don't need to worry about the details of music theory for this project. For the purpose of this project, all you need to know is that we will obtain a dataset of values, and will learn an RNN model to generate sequences of values.

The music generation system will use 78 unique values. Run the following code to load the raw music data and preprocess it into values. This might take a few minutes.


```python
X, Y, n_values, indices_values = load_music_utils()
print('shape of X:', X.shape)
print('number of training examples:', X.shape[0])
print('Tx (length of sequence):', X.shape[1])
print('total # of unique values:', n_values)
print('Shape of Y:', Y.shape)
```

    shape of X: (60, 30, 78)
    number of training examples: 60
    Tx (length of sequence): 30
    total # of unique values: 78
    Shape of Y: (30, 60, 78)


We have just loaded the following:

- `X`: This is an (m, Tx, 78) dimensional array. We have m training examples, each of which is a snippet of Tx =30 musical values. At each time step, the input is one of 78 different possible values, represented as a one-hot vector. Thus for example, X[i,t,:] is a one-hot vector representating the value of the i-th example at time t.

- `Y`: This is essentially the same as `X`, but shifted one step to the left (to the past). in this peoject, we're interested in the network using the previous values to predict the next value, so our sequence model will try to predict $y^{\langle t \rangle}$ given $x^{\langle 1\rangle}, \ldots, x^{\langle t \rangle}$. However, the data in `Y` is reordered to be dimension $(T_y, m, 78)$, where $T_y = T_x$. This format makes it more convenient to feed to the LSTM later.

- `n_values`: The number of unique values in this dataset. This should be 78.

- `indices_values`: python dictionary mapping from 0-77 to musical values.

### 1.2 - Overview of our model

Here is the architecture of the model we will use. This is similar to the Dinosaurus model I had used in the previous notebook, except that here we will be implementing it in Keras. The architecture is as follows:

<img src="images/music_generation.png" style="width:600;height:400px;">

<!--
<img src="images/djmodel.png" style="width:600;height:400px;">
<br>
<caption><center> **Figure 1**: LSTM model. $X = (x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, ..., x^{\langle T_x \rangle})$ is a window of size $T_x$ scanned over the musical corpus. Each $x^{\langle t \rangle}$ is an index corresponding to a value (ex: "A,0.250,< m2,P-4 >") while $\hat{y}$ is the prediction for the next value  </center></caption>
!-->

We will be training the model on random snippets of 30 values taken from a much longer piece of music. Thus, we won't bother to set the first input $x^{\langle 1 \rangle} = \vec{0}$, since now most of these snippets of audio start somewhere in the middle of a piece of music. We are setting each of the snippts to have the same length $T_x = 30$ to make vectorization easier.


## 2 - Building the model

In this part we will build and train a model that will learn musical patterns. To do so, we will need to build a model that takes in X of shape $(m, T_x, 78)$ and Y of shape $(T_y, m, 78)$. We will use an LSTM with 64 dimensional hidden states. Lets set `n_a = 64`.



```python
n_a = 64
```


Here's how we can create a Keras model with multiple inputs and outputs. If you're building an RNN where even at test time entire input sequence $x^{\langle 1 \rangle}, x^{\langle 2 \rangle}, \ldots, x^{\langle T_x \rangle}$ were *given in advance*, for example if the inputs were words and the output was a label, then Keras has simple built-in functions to build the model. However, for sequence generation, at test time we don't know all the values of $x^{\langle t\rangle}$ in advance; instead we generate them one at a time using $x^{\langle t\rangle} = y^{\langle t-1 \rangle}$. So the code will be a bit more complicated, and we'll need to implement for-loop to iterate over the different time steps.

The function `djmodel()` will call the LSTM layer $T_x$ times using a for-loop, and it is important that all $T_x$ copies have the same weights. I.e., it should not re-initiaiize the weights every time---the $T_x$ steps should have shared weights. The key steps for implementing layers with shareable weights in Keras are:
1. Define the layer objects (we will use global variables for this).
2. Call these objects when propagating the input.

We have defined the layers objects that need as global variables. Please run the next cell to create them. Please check the Keras documentation to make sure you understand what these layers are: [Reshape()](https://keras.io/layers/core/#reshape), [LSTM()](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm), [Dense()](https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense).



```python
reshapor = Reshape((1, 78))                        # Used in Step 2.B of djmodel(), below
LSTM_cell = LSTM(n_a, return_state = True)         # Used in Step 2.C
densor = Dense(n_values, activation='softmax')     # Used in Step 2.D
```

Each of `reshapor`, `LSTM_cell` and `densor` are now layer objects, and we can use them to implement `djmodel()`. In order to propagate a Keras tensor object X through one of these layers, we are using `layer_object(X)` (or `layer_object([X,Y])` if it requires multiple inputs.). For example, `reshapor(X)` will propagate X through the `Reshape((1,78))` layer defined above.


### Implementing `djmodel()`.

We will need to carry out 2 steps:

1. Create an empty list "outputs" to save the outputs of the LSTM Cell at every time step.
2. Loop for $t \in 1, \ldots, T_x$:

    A. Select the "t"th time-step vector from X. The shape of this selection should be (78,). To do so, create a custom [Lambda](https://keras.io/layers/core/#lambda) layer in Keras by using this line of code:
```    
           x = Lambda(lambda x: X[:,t,:])(X)
```
Look over the Keras documentation to figure out what this does. It is creating a "temporary" or "unnamed" function (that's what Lambda functions are) that extracts out the appropriate one-hot vector, and making this function a Keras `Layer` object to apply to `X`.

    B. Reshape x to be (1,78). You may find the `reshapor()` layer (defined below) helpful.

    C. Run x through one step of LSTM_cell. Remember to initialize the LSTM_cell with the previous step's hidden state $a$ and cell state $c$. Use the following formatting:
```python
a, _, c = LSTM_cell(input_x, initial_state=[previous hidden state, previous cell state])
```

    D. Propagate the LSTM's output activation value through a dense+softmax layer using `densor`.

    E. Append the predicted value to the list of "outputs"




```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: djmodel

def djmodel(Tx, n_a, n_values):
    """
    Implement the model

    Arguments:
    Tx -- length of the sequence in a corpus
    n_a -- the number of activations used in our model
    n_values -- number of unique values in the music data

    Returns:
    model -- a keras model with the
    """

    # Define the input of the model with a shape
    X = Input(shape=(Tx, n_values))

    # Define s0, initial hidden state for the decoder LSTM
    a0 = Input(shape=(n_a,), name='a0')
    c0 = Input(shape=(n_a,), name='c0')
    a = a0
    c = c0


    # Step 1: Create empty list to append the outputs while we iterate (≈1 line)
    outputs = []

    # Step 2: Loop
    for t in range(Tx):

        # Step 2.A: select the "t"th time step vector from X.
        x = Lambda(lambda x: X[:,t,:])(X)
        # Step 2.B: Use reshapor to reshape x to be (1, n_values) (≈1 line)
        x = reshapor(x)
        # Step 2.C: Perform one step of the LSTM_cell
        a, _, c = LSTM_cell(x, initial_state=[a, c])
        # Step 2.D: Apply densor to the hidden state output of LSTM_Cell
        out = densor(a)
        # Step 2.E: add the output to "outputs"
        outputs.append(out)

    # Step 3: Create model instance
    model = Model(inputs=[X,a0,c0],outputs=outputs)



    return model
```

Run the following cell to define the model. We will use `Tx=30`, `n_a=64` (the dimension of the LSTM activations), and `n_values=78`. This cell may take a few seconds to run.


```python
model = djmodel(Tx = 30 , n_a = 64, n_values = 78)
```

We now need to compile the model to be trained. We will Adam and a categorical cross-entropy loss.


```python
opt = Adam(lr=0.01, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, decay=0.01)

model.compile(optimizer=opt, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Finally, lets initialize `a0` and `c0` for the LSTM's initial state to be zero.


```python
m = 60
a0 = np.zeros((m, n_a))
c0 = np.zeros((m, n_a))
```

Lets now fit the model! We will turn `Y` to a list before doing so, since the cost function expects `Y` to be provided in this format (one list item per time-step). So `list(Y)` is a list with 30 items, where each of the list items is of shape (60,78). Lets train for 100 epochs. This will take a few minutes.




```python
model.fit([X, a0, c0], list(Y), epochs=100)
```

We can see the model loss going down. Now that we have trained a model, lets go on the the final section to implement an inference algorithm, and generate some music!

## 3 - Generating music

We now have a trained model which has learned the patterns of the jazz soloist. Lets now use this model to synthesize new music.

#### 3.1 - Predicting & Sampling

<img src="images/music_gen.png" style="width:600;height:400px;">

At each step of sampling, we will take as input the activation `a` and cell state `c` from the previous state of the LSTM, forward propagate by one step, and get a new output activation as well as cell state. The new activation `a` can then be used to generate the output, using `densor` as before.

To start off the model, we will initialize `x0` as well as the LSTM activation and and cell value `a0` and `c0` to be zeros.


<!--
We are about to build a function that will do this inference. The function takes in the previous model and the number of time steps `Ty` that we want to sample. It will return a keras model that would be able to generate sequencee. Furthermore, the function takes in a dense layer of `78` units and the number of activations.
!-->


Implementing the function below to sample a sequence of musical values. Here are some of the key steps we'll need to implement inside the for-loop that generates the $T_y$ output characters:

Step 2.A: Use `LSTM_Cell`, which inputs the previous step's `c` and `a` to generate the current step's `c` and `a`.

Step 2.B: Use `densor` (defined previously) to compute a softmax on `a` to get the output for the current step.

Step 2.C: Save the output we have just generated by appending it to `outputs`.

Step 2.D: Sample x to the be "out"'s one-hot version (the prediction) so that we can pass it to the next LSTM's step.  We have already provided this line of code, which uses a [Lambda](https://keras.io/layers/core/#lambda) function.
```python
x = Lambda(one_hot)(out)
```
[Minor technical note: Rather than sampling a value at random according to the probabilities in `out`, this line of code actually chooses the single most likely note at each step using an argmax.]



```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: music_inference_model

def music_inference_model(LSTM_cell, densor, n_values = 78, n_a = 64, Ty = 100):

    c0 = Input(shape=(n_a,), name='c0')
    a = a0
    c = c0
    x = x0


    # Step 1: Create an empty list of "outputs" to later store the predicted values (≈1 line)
    outputs = []

    # Step 2: Loop over Ty and generate a value at every time step

        # Step 2.A: Perform one step of LSTM_cell (≈1 line)
        a, _, c = LSTM_cell(x, initial_state=[a, c])

        # Step 2.B: Apply Dense layer to the hidden state output of the LSTM_cell (≈1 line)
        out = densor(a)

        # Step 2.C: Append the prediction "out" to "outputs". out.shape = (None, 78) (≈1 line)
        outputs.append(out)

        # Step 2.D: Select the next value according to "out", and set "x" to be the one-hot representation of the
        #           selected value, which will be passed as the input to LSTM_cell on the next step.
        x =  Lambda(one_hot)(out)

    # Step 3: Create model instance with the correct "inputs" and "outputs" (≈1 line)
    inference_model = Model(inputs=[x0,a0,c0],outputs=outputs)



    return inference_model
```

Run the cell below to define the inference model. This model is hard coded to generate 50 values.


```python
inference_model = music_inference_model(LSTM_cell, densor, n_values = 78, n_a = 64, Ty = 50)
```

Finally, this creates the zero-valued vectors we will use to initialize `x` and the LSTM state variables `a` and `c`.


```python
x_initializer = np.zeros((1, 1, 78))
a_initializer = np.zeros((1, n_a))
c_initializer = np.zeros((1, n_a))
```

### Implementing `predict_and_sample()`.

This function takes many arguments including the inputs [x_initializer, a_initializer, c_initializer]. In order to predict the output corresponding to this input, we will need to carry-out 3 steps:
1. Use the inference model to predict an output given set of inputs. The output `pred` should be a list of length 20 where each element is a numpy-array of shape ($T_y$, n_values)
2. Convert `pred` into a numpy array of $T_y$ indices. Each index corresponds is computed by taking the `argmax` of an element of the `pred` list. [Hint](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argmax.html).
3. Convert the indices into their one-hot vector representations. [Hint](https://keras.io/utils/#to_categorical).


```python
# GRADED FUNCTION: predict_and_sample

def predict_and_sample(inference_model, x_initializer = x_initializer, a_initializer = a_initializer,
                       c_initializer = c_initializer):

    # Step 1: Use the inference model to predict an output sequence given x_initializer, a_initializer and c_initializer.
    pred =  inference_model.predict([x_initializer,a_initializer,c_initializer])
    # Step 2: Convert "pred" into an np.array() of indices with the maximum probabilities
    indices = np.argmax(pred, axis = -1)
    # Step 3: Convert indices to one-hot vectors, the shape of the results should be (1, )
    results = to_categorical(indices,num_classes=78)


    return results, indices

```python
results, indices = predict_and_sample(inference_model, x_initializer, a_initializer, c_initializer)
print("np.argmax(results[12]) =", np.argmax(results[12]))
print("np.argmax(results[17]) =", np.argmax(results[17]))
print("list(indices[12:18]) =", list(indices[12:18]))
```

    np.argmax(results[12]) = 33
    np.argmax(results[17]) = 15
    list(indices[12:18]) = [array([33], dtype=int64), array([76], dtype=int64), array([5], dtype=int64), array([42], dtype=int64), array([14], dtype=int64), array([15], dtype=int64)]


The results are differ because Keras' results are not completely predictable. However, if we have trained the LSTM_cell with model.fit() for exactly 100 epochs as described above, we should very likely observe a sequence of indices that are not all identical. Moreover, we should observe that: np.argmax(results[12]) is the first element of list(indices[12:18]) and np.argmax(results[17]) is the last element of list(indices[12:18]).

#### 3.3 - Generate music

Finally, we are ready to generate music. The RNN generates a sequence of values. The following code generates music by first calling the `predict_and_sample()` function. These values are then post-processed into musical chords (meaning that multiple values or notes can be played at the same time).

Most computational music algorithms use some post-processing because it is difficult to generate music that sounds good without such post-processing. The post-processing does things such as clean up the generated audio by making sure the same sound is not repeated too many times, that two successive notes are not too far from each other in pitch, and so on. One could argue that a lot of these post-processing steps are hacks; also, a lot the music generation literature has also focused on hand-crafting post-processors, and a lot of the output quality depends on the quality of the post-processing and not just the quality of the RNN. But this post-processing does make a huge difference, so lets use it in the implementation as well.

Lets make some music!

Run the following cell to generate music and record it into the `out_stream`. This can take a couple of minutes.


```python
out_stream = generate_music(inference_model)
```

    Predicting new values for different set of chords.
    Generated 51 sounds using the predicted values for the set of chords ("1") and after pruning
    Generated 50 sounds using the predicted values for the set of chords ("2") and after pruning
    Generated 50 sounds using the predicted values for the set of chords ("3") and after pruning
    Generated 51 sounds using the predicted values for the set of chords ("4") and after pruning
    Generated 51 sounds using the predicted values for the set of chords ("5") and after pruning
    Your generated music is saved in output/my_music.midi


To listen to the music, click File->Open... Then go to "output/" and download "my_music.midi". Either play it on the computer with an application that can read midi files if you have one, or use one of the free online "MIDI to mp3" conversion tools to convert this to mp3.  

As reference, here also is a 30sec audio clip we generated using this algorithm.


```python
IPython.display.Audio('./data/30s_trained_model.mp3')
```

### Congratulations!

You have come to the end of the notebook.

<font color="blue">
Here's what you should remember:
               
- A sequence model can be used to generate musical values, which are then post-processed into midi music.
- Fairly similar models can be used to generate dinosaur names or to generate music, with the major difference being the input fed to the model.  
- In Keras, sequence generation involves defining layers with shared weights, which are then repeated for the different time steps $1, \ldots, T_x$.

Congratulations on generating a jazz solo!
